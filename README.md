# duck-shell-prototype
A very simple desktop based on openbox-session and inspired by crunchbang, with the addition of Duck Launcher and Duck Panel. 
The aim is to create a new, innovative, desktop experience, which would give a lot more sense to Duck Launcher, which is now only a dock.
For now, it's only openbox-session's code with different directories, just to start by something (And this is just the very early stuff, so I haven't taken care of of licencing yet)
